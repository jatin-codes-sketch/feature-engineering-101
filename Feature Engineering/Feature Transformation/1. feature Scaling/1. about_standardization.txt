ðŸ“˜ STANDARDIZATION IN FEATURE ENGINEERING

ðŸ”¹ What is Standardization?
Standardization is a feature scaling technique used to bring all features onto a similar scale. 
It transforms the data so that each feature has:
- Mean = 0
- Standard Deviation = 1

Formula:
    z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ

Where:
    x  = original value
    Î¼  = mean of the feature
    Ïƒ  = standard deviation of the feature
    z  = standardized value

ðŸ”¹ Why Use Standardization?
- Some machine learning models (like SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression) perform better when data is standardized.
- It helps features with larger values not dominate the model.
- It improves convergence speed during training.
- It makes the model more stable and accurate.

ðŸ”¹ When to Use Standardization?
- When your features are normally distributed or close to it.
- When using models that are sensitive to feature scales.

ðŸ”¹ How to Apply Standardization in Python:
Using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
