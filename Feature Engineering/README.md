# üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering in Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Feature Engineering** repository! This project is part of my learning journey, where I explore how to convert raw data into meaningful features that improve machine learning model performance.

## üìå What is Feature Engineering?

Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to increase the predictive power of machine learning models. Good feature engineering often determines the success of a model more than the choice of algorithm.

## üîç Types of Feature Engineering

### 1. Handling Missing Values
Missing data can reduce the accuracy of models. Common techniques include:
- Removing missing data
- Replacing with mean, median, or mode
- Forward/Backward fill

### 2. Encoding Categorical Variables
Machine learning models require numeric input, so we need to encode text labels:
- **Label Encoding**
- **One-Hot Encoding**
- **Ordinal Encoding**

### 3. Feature Scaling
Features with different ranges can affect model performance. Common techniques:
- **Standardization (Z-score scaling)**
- **Normalization (Min-Max scaling)**

### 4. Feature Transformation
Used to make data distributions more normal or reduce skewness:
- **Log Transformation**
- **Square Root Transformation**
- **Reciprocal Transformation**

### 5. Feature Extraction (Coming Soon)
Creating new features from existing data:
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)
- Image feature extraction
- Date/time-based features

### 6. Feature Selection (Coming Soon)
Selecting the most relevant features:
- Correlation analysis
- Univariate selection
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
