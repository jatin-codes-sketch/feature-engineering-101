📘 MAXABS SCALER IN FEATURE ENGINEERING

🔹 What is MaxAbsScaler?
MaxAbsScaler is a feature scaling technique that scales each feature by its maximum absolute value. It transforms the data into the range [-1, 1] without shifting the mean or breaking sparsity.

Formula:

                    𝑧=x/max(|x|)

where: 
    x=original value
    max(|x|)=maximum absolute value of the feature 
    z=scaled value


🔹 Why Use MaxAbsScaler?

It preserves the sparsity of data (important for sparse datasets like text data).

Does not shift/center the data (no mean subtraction).

Useful when you want to scale data but keep zero entries unchanged.

Scales features into the range [-1, 1].

🔹 When to Use MaxAbsScaler?

For datasets with many zero values (sparse data).

When features have both positive and negative values and you want to keep the distribution centered.

When you want simple scaling without changing the mean.

🔹 How to Apply MaxAbsScaler in Python:
Using scikit-learn:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler

scaler = MaxAbsScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
